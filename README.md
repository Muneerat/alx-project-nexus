# üó≥Ô∏è ProDev FE: Real-Time Online Poll System

## Project Overview

The **Real-Time Online Poll System** is an interactive web application designed to simulate a real-world platform where users can create, vote on, and view the live results of polls. This project emphasizes modern front-end development practices, focusing on **real-time data updates**, **efficient state management**, and **dynamic data visualization** to deliver a seamless user experience.

## üéØ Project Goals

The primary objectives for developing this platform were to gain hands-on experience with:

* **API Integration:** Successfully fetch and display poll questions and real-time results from a backend API.
* **State Management:** Utilize **Redux** to efficiently manage complex application state, ensuring predictability and maintainability.
* **Dynamic Visualizations:** Implement a charting library to visually represent live poll results, updating charts without requiring a page refresh.
* **Type Safety:** Employ **TypeScript** across the codebase for enhanced type checking and maintainability.
